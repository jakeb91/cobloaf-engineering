**For end-users**, this blog contains my personal opinions based on well over a decade of witnessing various IT & Telecommunications engineering or customer-service disasters where either companies or customers shoot themselves in the foot for reasons of varying complexity. In expressing these opinions I will often make fun of people that watch Linus Tech-Tips or subscribe to the Apple eco-system, this is just banter so don't stress.

**For Support engineers** and other customer support facing roles, this page exists to help you improve your skills, serve your customers better and drive your senior engineers slightly less (or more) crazy.

**For my industry peers** and colleagues this exists for your entertainment and to make fun of all the things I get wrong - because where would the fun be if we were right all the time right?

My name is Jacob Bisby, and I am a Service Provider Network Architect & Engineer\* based in Australia.  
\*_I also do a-lot of Systems Engineering and VoIP Engineering._
